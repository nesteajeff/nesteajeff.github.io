            <p>Hello! I am Jeffrey Peng. I currently attend the University of Waterloo pursuing a degree in Computer Science. 
                My interest in software development began in 2016 when I began learning with Codeacademy. In high school, 
                I participated in multiple hackathons, one of which I placed first with my team where we created a Map of Mini
                Games. I worked on multiple projects throughout high school such as Chess which was created for my grade 12
                final project. In University, I learned new software languages and completed projects such as
                the Ideal Stock Market Portfolio which was for a class competition that my team placed first in.
            </p>
            <p2>I worked for RentalPoint Software this past spring term. I converted files into different formats
                and converted code from Pascal to C#. I also used SQL to get different classes into the files.
            </p2>
